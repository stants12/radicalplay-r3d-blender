Blender plugin which allows you to import/export Need For Madness Re-Lit's and Sky Mad's .r3d model files.
# Issues
- When importing, textures do not get auto-assigned, you'll have to set them yourself in Blender.
# Installing
Open the Edit -> Preferences window from the menu bar, go to Add-ons, click on the Install button, and select the python script you downloaded. Then, enable the script by checking the box next to it.
# Terms of Use
You are free to do anything with this.
