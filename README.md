Currently supports importing Need For Madness Re-Lit's .r3d model files, only extensively tested with car and track piece models.
# Issues
- For now textures do not get auto-assigned, you'll have to set them yourself.
- Exporting to .r3d is incomplete and unstable.
- Sky Mad's .r3d is untested.
# Installing
Open the Edit -> Preferences window from the menu bar, go to Add-ons, click on the Install button, and select the python script you downloaded. Then, enable the script by checking the box next to it.
